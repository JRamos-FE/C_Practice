1.1 Getting Started
	*A C program, no matter size, consists of functions and variables.
	*A function contains statements that specify the computing operations to be done,
	 and variables store values used during the computations
	*A C program begins executing at main function
	*One method of communicating data between functions is for the calling function to provide 		 a list of values, called arguments, to the function it calls.
	*The paranthesis after the function name surround the argument list.
	*printf never supplies a newline automatically, so several calls may be used to build
	 up an output line in stages.
	*Hard to type or invisible characters are represented by escape sequences.
	*Examples of escape sequences:
		\t for tab
		\b for backspace
		\" for double quotes
		\\ for backslash itself
